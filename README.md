## BYTEsense, our project for Hack the North 2023.

BYTEsense is a project created by Savir Singh, Dolev Klein, Manasvi Bandi, and Nithya Majeti for Hack the North 2023. BYTEsense is an AI powered tool which personalizes itself to a users individual dietary needs. First, you tell the app what foods you ate, and rate your experience afterwards on a scale of 1-3 - The app then breaks down the food into its individual ingredients, remembers how your experience with them, and stores them to be referenced later. Then, after a sufficient amount of data has been collected, you can use the app to predict how NEW foods can affect you through our "How will I feel if I consume..." function!
